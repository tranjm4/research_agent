Furthermore, we outline future research opportunities, highlighting the potential promising directions. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological picture for educators, researchers, and policymakers to harness the power of LLMs to revolutionize educational practices and foster a more effective personalized learning environment. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)\\nDocument 2: With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs, several exciting products and applications are emerging, many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04613)\\nDocument 3: Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated.

This paper explores the application, implications, and potential of LLMs in building energy efficiency and decarbonization studies. The wide-ranging capabilities of LLMs are examined in the context of the building energy field, including intelligent control systems, code generation, data infrastructure, knowledge extraction, and education. Despite the promising potential of LLMs, challenges including complex and expensive computation, data privacy, security and copyright, complexity in fine-tuned LLMs, and self-consistency are discussed. The paper concludes with a call for future research focused on the enhancement of LLMs for domain-specific tasks, multi-modal LLMs, and collaborative research between AI and energy experts.

In higher education, concerns have emerged such as students\\' misuse of LLMs and degraded education outcomes. To unpack the ethical concerns of LLMs for higher education, we conducted a case study consisting of stakeholder interviews (n=20) in higher education computer science. We found that students use several distinct mental models to interact with LLMs - LLMs serve as a tool for (a) writing, (b) coding, and (c) information retrieval, which differ somewhat in ethical considerations. Students and teachers brought up ethical issues that directly impact them, such as inaccurate LLM responses, hallucinations, biases, privacy leakage, and academic integrity issues. Participants emphasized the necessity of guidance and rules for the use of LLMs in higher education, including teaching digital literacy, rethinking education, and having cautious and contextual policies. We reflect on the ethical challenges and propose solutions. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12453)\\nDocument 2: The universal availability of ChatGPT and other similar tools since late 2022 has prompted tremendous public excitement and experimental effort about the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve learning experience and outcomes, especially for learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, little research has systematically examined the real-world impacts of LLM availability on educational equity beyond theoretical projections and controlled studies of innovative LLM applications. To depict trends of post-LLM inequalities, we analyze 1,140,328 academic writing submissions from 16,791 college students across 2,391 courses between 2021 and 2024 at a public, minority-serving institution in the US. We find that students\\' overall writing quality gradually increased following the availability of LLMs and that the writing quality gaps between linguistically advantaged and disadvantaged students became increasingly narrower. However, this equitizing effect was more concentrated on students with higher socioeconomic status. These findings shed light on the digital divides in the era of LLMs and raise questions about the equity benefits of LLMs in early stages and highlight the need for researchers and practitioners on developing responsible practices to improve educational equity through LLMs. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22282)\\nDocument 3: The rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted discussions in academic circles, with students exploring LLM-based tools for coursework inquiries and instructors exploring them for teaching and research. Even though a lot of work is underway to create LLM-based tools tailored for students and instructors, there is a lack of comprehensive user studies that capture the perspectives of students and instructors regarding LLMs. This paper addresses this gap by conducting surveys and interviews within undergraduate engineering universities in India. Using 1306 survey responses among students, 112 student interviews, and 27 instructor interviews around the academic usage of ChatGPT (a popular LLM), this paper offers insights into the current usage patterns, perceived benefits, threats, and challenges, as well as recommendations for enhancing the adoption of LLMs among students and instructors. These insights are further utilized to discuss the practical implications of LLMs in undergraduate engineering education and beyond. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10694)\\nDocument 4: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course \"Digital Image Processing\". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.

We introduce IMP-TIP: Improving Math Reasoning with Tool-augmented Interleaf Prompting, a framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and Tool-augmented LLMs. IMP-TIP follows the ``From Good to Great\" concept, collecting multiple potential solutions from both LLMs and their Tool-Augmented counterparts for the same math problem, and then selecting or re-generating the most accurate answer after cross-checking these solutions via tool-augmented interleaf prompting. The framework incorporates two key aspects: self-prompt and tool-augmented interleaf prompting (TIP). The former allows LLMs to autonomously refine and improve an initial prompt related to tool usage, while the latter enables LLMs to derive the final answer by dynamically analyzing the problem, cross-checking potential solutions, and revising previous reasoning hints in an interleaved manner. Experimental analysis shows that IMP-TIP achieves enhanced mathematical capabilities and outperforms traditional LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs in accuracy and reasoning diversity on math reasoning tasks. For instance, IMP-TIP can improve Tool-augmented ChatGPT on GSM8K-Hard from 56.0% to 65.2%.

This survey paper summarizes the various technologies of LLMs in educational settings from multifaceted perspectives, encompassing student and teacher assistance, adaptive learning, and commercial tools. We systematically review the technological advancements in each perspective, organize related datasets and benchmarks, and identify the risks and challenges associated with deploying LLMs in education. Furthermore, we outline future research opportunities, highlighting the potential promising directions. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological picture for educators, researchers, and policymakers to harness the power of LLMs to revolutionize educational practices and foster a more effective personalized learning environment. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)\\nDocument 2: With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs, several exciting products and applications are emerging, many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04613)\\nDocument 3: Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13615)\\nDocument 4: This paper provides a primer on Large Language Models (LLMs) and identifies their strengths, limitations, applications and research directions. It is intended to be useful to those in academia and industry who are interested in gaining an understanding of the key LLM concepts and technologies, and in utilising this knowledge in both day to day tasks and in more complex scenarios where this technology can enhance current practices and processes. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04503)\\nDocument 5: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.

Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological picture for educators, researchers, and policymakers to harness the power of LLMs to revolutionize educational practices and foster a more effective personalized learning environment. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)\\nDocument 2: With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs, several exciting products and applications are emerging, many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04613)\\nDocument 3: Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated.

It is intended to be useful to those in academia and industry who are interested in gaining an understanding of the key LLM concepts and technologies, and in utilising this knowledge in both day to day tasks and in more complex scenarios where this technology can enhance current practices and processes. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04503)\\nDocument 5: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.

This survey paper summarizes the various technologies of LLMs in educational settings from multifaceted perspectives, encompassing student and teacher assistance, adaptive learning, and commercial tools. We systematically review the technological advancements in each perspective, organize related datasets and benchmarks, and identify the risks and challenges associated with deploying LLMs in education. Furthermore, we outline future research opportunities, highlighting the potential promising directions. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological picture for educators, researchers, and policymakers to harness the power of LLMs to revolutionize educational practices and foster a more effective personalized learning environment. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)\\nDocument 2: With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs, several exciting products and applications are emerging, many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04613)\\nDocument 3: Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13615)\\nDocument 4: This paper provides a primer on Large Language Models (LLMs) and identifies their strengths, limitations, applications and research directions. It is intended to be useful to those in academia and industry who are interested in gaining an understanding of the key LLM concepts and technologies, and in utilising this knowledge in both day to day tasks and in more complex scenarios where this technology can enhance current practices and processes. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04503)\\nDocument 5: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.

Since the tweets on Twitter are usually short and express public feelings, thus provide a source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis for global events. This paper proposed an effective solution, in providing a sentiment on tweets related to the FIFA World Cup. At least 130k tweets, as the first in the community, are collected and implemented as a dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed machine learning solution. These tweets are collected with the related hashtags and keywords of the Qatar World Cup 2022. The Vader algorithm is used in this paper for sentiment analysis. Through the machine learning method and collected Twitter tweets, we discovered the sentiments and fun facts of several aspects important to the period before the World Cup.

Inspired by a recent work studying the problem with the tools from the literature on fair allocation, this paper provides an alternative approach based on historical matches between these sets of teams. We focus on the FIFA World Cup due to the existence of an official rating system and its recent expansion to 48 teams, as well as to allow for a comparison with the already suggested allocations. Our proposal extends the methodology of the FIFA World Ranking to compare the strengths of five confederations. Various allocations are presented depending on the length of the sample, the set of teams considered, as well as the frequency of rating updates. The results show that more European and South American teams should play in the FIFA World Cup. The ranking of continents by the number of deserved slots is different from the ranking implied by FIFA policy. We recommend allocating at least some slots transparently, based on historical performances, similar to the access list of the UEFA Champions League.

This conference follows the previous meetings at Leiden (2018), Oxford (2019), MIT (2020, fully online), and Cambridge (2021). The conference comprised 59 contributed talks, a poster session, an industry showcase session, and a session where junior researchers who had attended the Adjoint School presented the results of their research at the school. Information regarding the conference may be found at (https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/act2022).\\n  The contributions to ACT2022 ranged from pure to applied and included contributions in a wide range of disciplines in science and engineering. ACT2022 included talks in linguistics, functional programming, classical mechanics, quantum physics, probability theory, electrical engineering, epidemiology, thermodynamics, engineering, and logic. ACT2022 was sponsored by Huawei, Protocol Labs, Cambridge Quantum, Conexus, Topos, and SICSA (Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance).\\n  Submission to ACT2022 had three tracks: extended abstracts, software demonstrations, and proceedings. The extended abstract and software demonstration submissions had a page limit of 2 pages, and the proceedings track had a page limit of 14 pages. Only papers submitted to the proceedings track were considered for publication in this volume. In total, there were 97 submissions, of which 59 were accepted for presentation and 24 for publication in this volume. Publication of accepted submissions in the proceedings was determined by personal choice of the authors and not based on quality. Each submission received a review from three different members of the programming committee, and papers were selected based on discussion and consensus by these reviewers.

Since the tweets on Twitter are usually short and express public feelings, thus provide a source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis for global events. This paper proposed an effective solution, in providing a sentiment on tweets related to the FIFA World Cup. At least 130k tweets, as the first in the community, are collected and implemented as a dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed machine learning solution. These tweets are collected with the related hashtags and keywords of the Qatar World Cup 2022. The Vader algorithm is used in this paper for sentiment analysis. Through the machine learning method and collected Twitter tweets, we discovered the sentiments and fun facts of several aspects important to the period before the World Cup. The result shows people are positive to the opening of the World Cup.

Inspired by a recent work studying the problem with the tools from the literature on fair allocation, this paper provides an alternative approach based on historical matches between these sets of teams. We focus on the FIFA World Cup due to the existence of an official rating system and its recent expansion to 48 teams, as well as to allow for a comparison with the already suggested allocations. Our proposal extends the methodology of the FIFA World Ranking to compare the strengths of five confederations. Various allocations are presented depending on the length of the sample, the set of teams considered, as well as the frequency of rating updates. The results show that more European and South American teams should play in the FIFA World Cup. The ranking of continents by the number of deserved slots is different from the ranking implied by FIFA policy. We recommend allocating at least some slots transparently, based on historical performances, similar to the access list of the UEFA Champions League.

Since the tweets on Twitter are usually short and express public feelings, thus provide a source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis for global events. This paper proposed an effective solution, in providing a sentiment on tweets related to the FIFA World Cup. At least 130k tweets, as the first in the community, are collected and implemented as a dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed machine learning solution. These tweets are collected with the related hashtags and keywords of the Qatar World Cup 2022. The Vader algorithm is used in this paper for sentiment analysis. Through the machine learning method and collected Twitter tweets, we discovered the sentiments and fun facts of several aspects important to the period before the World Cup. The result shows people are positive to the opening of the World Cup.

Inspired by a recent work studying the problem with the tools from the literature on fair allocation, this paper provides an alternative approach based on historical matches between these sets of teams. We focus on the FIFA World Cup due to the existence of an official rating system and its recent expansion to 48 teams, as well as to allow for a comparison with the already suggested allocations. Our proposal extends the methodology of the FIFA World Ranking to compare the strengths of five confederations. Various allocations are presented depending on the length of the sample, the set of teams considered, as well as the frequency of rating updates. The results show that more European and South American teams should play in the FIFA World Cup. The ranking of continents by the number of deserved slots is different from the ranking implied by FIFA policy. We recommend allocating at least some slots transparently, based on historical performances, similar to the access list of the UEFA Champions League.

In this paper, we have carried out a comparative evaluation of statistical and machine learning models to assess their predictive performance for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and for the 2023 CAF Africa Cup of Nations by evaluating alternative summaries of past performances related to the involved teams. More specifically, we consider the Bayesian Bradley-Terry-Davidson model, which is a widely used statistical framework for ranking items based on paired comparisons that have been applied successfully in various domains, including football. The analysis was performed including in some canonical goal-based models both the Bradley-Terry-Davidson derived ranking and the widely recognized Coca-Cola FIFA ranking commonly adopted by football fans and amateurs.

In this paper, we have carried out a comparative evaluation of statistical and machine learning models to assess their predictive performance for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and for the 2023 CAF Africa Cup of Nations by evaluating alternative summaries of past performances related to the involved teams. More specifically, we consider the Bayesian Bradley-Terry-Davidson model, which is a widely used statistical framework for ranking items based on paired comparisons that have been applied successfully in various domains, including football. The analysis was performed including in some canonical goal-based models both the Bradley-Terry-Davidson derived ranking and the widely recognized Coca-Cola FIFA ranking commonly adopted by football fans and amateurs.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach.

It explores the trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational resources, with the aim of maximizing the efficiency of these AI systems. The research explores novel methods that allow different parts of the model to share parameters, reducing the total number of unique parameters required. This approach ensures that the model remains compact without sacrificing its ability to learn and represent complex language structures. This study provides valuable insights and tools for creating more efficient and effective LLMs, contributing to a more sustainable and accessible future for AI language modeling. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06589)\\nDocument 2: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.

There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination.

However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLM inference pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Efforts within the field have been directed towards developing techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach. Then, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the current literature into data-level, model-level, and system-level optimization. Moreover, the paper includes comparative experiments on representative methods within critical sub-fields to provide quantitative insights. Last but not least, we provide some knowledge summary and discuss future research directions.

This survey paper summarizes the various technologies of LLMs in educational settings from multifaceted perspectives, encompassing student and teacher assistance, adaptive learning, and commercial tools. We systematically review the technological advancements in each perspective, organize related datasets and benchmarks, and identify the risks and challenges associated with deploying LLMs in education. Furthermore, we outline future research opportunities, highlighting the potential promising directions. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological picture for educators, researchers, and policymakers to harness the power of LLMs to revolutionize educational practices and foster a more effective personalized learning environment. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)\\nDocument 2: With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs, several exciting products and applications are emerging, many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04613)\\nDocument 3: Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated.

It is intended to be useful to those in academia and industry who are interested in gaining an understanding of the key LLM concepts and technologies, and in utilising this knowledge in both day to day tasks and in more complex scenarios where this technology can enhance current practices and processes. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04503)\\nDocument 5: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking sequence, and heterostructure composition. Then we highlight the exploration of 2D single crystals in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Finally, a perspective is given to outline the research opportunities and the remaining challenges in this field. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08266)\\nDocument 2: 2D materials with high charge carrier mobility and tunable electronic band gaps have attracted intense research effort for their potential use as active components in nanoelectronics. 2D-conjugated polymers (2DCP) constitute a promising sub-class due to the fact that the electronic band structure can be manipulated by varying the molecular building blocks, while at the same time preserving the key features of 2D materials such as Dirac cones and high charge mobility. The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

By summarizing the current trends in and prospects for utilizing multifunctional electrochromic devices (ECDs) in environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diagnosis, and life science-related investigations, we explore the potential of using 2D materials for rational design of ECDs with compelling electrical and optical properties for biochemical sensing applications.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

We show how to reduce the three--dimensional energy functional to a one--dimensional one, similarly as in our previous work. This is done by minimizing over states invariant under magnetic translations and that commute with the Landau operator. In the reduced model, the Pauli principle no longer appears. It is replaced by a penalization term in the energy.

We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment.

(https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215)\\nDocument 2: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces substantial challenges when applied to real-life problems, primarily stemming from the scarcity of available data due to limited interactions with the environment. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications.

However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency.

However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations.

However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking sequence, and heterostructure composition. Then we highlight the exploration of 2D single crystals in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Finally, a perspective is given to outline the research opportunities and the remaining challenges in this field.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

By summarizing the current trends in and prospects for utilizing multifunctional electrochromic devices (ECDs) in environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diagnosis, and life science-related investigations, we explore the potential of using 2D materials for rational design of ECDs with compelling electrical and optical properties for biochemical sensing applications.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

We show how to reduce the three--dimensional energy functional to a one--dimensional one, similarly as in our previous work. This is done by minimizing over states invariant under magnetic translations and that commute with the Landau operator. In the reduced model, the Pauli principle no longer appears. It is replaced by a penalization term in the energy.

This makes the application of RL to novel problems of interest inaccessible to small organisations or private individuals with insufficient engineering expertise. This position paper argues that, to enable more widespread adoption of RL, it is important for the research community to shift focus towards methodologies where environments are described in user-friendly domain-specific or natural languages. Aside from improving the usability of RL, such language-based environment descriptions may also provide valuable context and boost the ability of trained agents to generalise to unseen environments within the set of all environments that can be described in any language of choice.

In this paper, we implement an optics simulation environment for reinforcement learning based controllers. The environment captures the essence of nonconvexity, nonlinearity, and time-dependent noise inherent in optical systems, offering a more realistic setting. Subsequently, we provide the benchmark results of several reinforcement learning algorithms on the proposed simulation environment. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of off-policy reinforcement learning approaches over traditional control algorithms in navigating the intricacies of complex optical control environments.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04570)\\nDocument 4: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a flexible and efficient method for programming micro-robots in complex environments. Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01999)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in particular, have the potential to disrupt and are already changing the way we interact with the world. One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

This position paper argues that, to enable more widespread adoption of RL, it is important for the research community to shift focus towards methodologies where environments are described in user-friendly domain-specific or natural languages. Aside from improving the usability of RL, such language-based environment descriptions may also provide valuable context and boost the ability of trained agents to generalise to unseen environments within the set of all environments that can be described in any language of choice.

In this paper, we implement an optics simulation environment for reinforcement learning based controllers. The environment captures the essence of nonconvexity, nonlinearity, and time-dependent noise inherent in optical systems, offering a more realistic setting. Subsequently, we provide the benchmark results of several reinforcement learning algorithms on the proposed simulation environment. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of off-policy reinforcement learning approaches over traditional control algorithms in navigating the intricacies of complex optical control environments.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions.

One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping.

This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications.

However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency.

However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations.

However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

We show how to reduce the three--dimensional energy functional to a one--dimensional one, similarly as in our previous work. This is done by minimizing over states invariant under magnetic translations and that commute with the Landau operator. In the reduced model, the Pauli principle no longer appears. It is replaced by a penalization term in the energy.

This makes the application of RL to novel problems of interest inaccessible to small organisations or private individuals with insufficient engineering expertise. This position paper argues that, to enable more widespread adoption of RL, it is important for the research community to shift focus towards methodologies where environments are described in user-friendly domain-specific or natural languages. Aside from improving the usability of RL, such language-based environment descriptions may also provide valuable context and boost the ability of trained agents to generalise to unseen environments within the set of all environments that can be described in any language of choice.

In this paper, we implement an optics simulation environment for reinforcement learning based controllers. The environment captures the essence of nonconvexity, nonlinearity, and time-dependent noise inherent in optical systems, offering a more realistic setting. Subsequently, we provide the benchmark results of several reinforcement learning algorithms on the proposed simulation environment. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of off-policy reinforcement learning approaches over traditional control algorithms in navigating the intricacies of complex optical control environments.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions.

One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215)\\nDocument 2: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces substantial challenges when applied to real-life problems, primarily stemming from the scarcity of available data due to limited interactions with the environment. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10069)\\nDocument 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency.

However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations.

However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01999)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in particular, have the potential to disrupt and are already changing the way we interact with the world. One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215)\\nDocument 2: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces substantial challenges when applied to real-life problems, primarily stemming from the scarcity of available data due to limited interactions with the environment. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10069)\\nDocument 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00732)\\nDocument 4: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used to solve tasks where the environment consistently provides a dense reward value. However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21338)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement Learning offers a framework to learn to choose actions in order to achieve some goal. However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking sequence, and heterostructure composition. Then we highlight the exploration of 2D single crystals in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01999)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in particular, have the potential to disrupt and are already changing the way we interact with the world. One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains.

This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10069)\\nDocument 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00732)\\nDocument 4: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used to solve tasks where the environment consistently provides a dense reward value. However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21338)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement Learning offers a framework to learn to choose actions in order to achieve some goal. However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking sequence, and heterostructure composition.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01999)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in particular, have the potential to disrupt and are already changing the way we interact with the world. One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215)\\nDocument 2: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces substantial challenges when applied to real-life problems, primarily stemming from the scarcity of available data due to limited interactions with the environment. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10069)\\nDocument 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00732)\\nDocument 4: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used to solve tasks where the environment consistently provides a dense reward value. However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21338)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement Learning offers a framework to learn to choose actions in order to achieve some goal. However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking sequence, and heterostructure composition. Then we highlight the exploration of 2D single crystals in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

This position paper argues that, to enable more widespread adoption of RL, it is important for the research community to shift focus towards methodologies where environments are described in user-friendly domain-specific or natural languages. Aside from improving the usability of RL, such language-based environment descriptions may also provide valuable context and boost the ability of trained agents to generalise to unseen environments within the set of all environments that can be described in any language of choice.

In this paper, we implement an optics simulation environment for reinforcement learning based controllers. The environment captures the essence of nonconvexity, nonlinearity, and time-dependent noise inherent in optical systems, offering a more realistic setting. Subsequently, we provide the benchmark results of several reinforcement learning algorithms on the proposed simulation environment. The experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of off-policy reinforcement learning approaches over traditional control algorithms in navigating the intricacies of complex optical control environments.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01999)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in particular, have the potential to disrupt and are already changing the way we interact with the world. One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215)\\nDocument 2: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces substantial challenges when applied to real-life problems, primarily stemming from the scarcity of available data due to limited interactions with the environment. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10069)\\nDocument 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00732)\\nDocument 4: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used to solve tasks where the environment consistently provides a dense reward value. However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21338)\\nDocument 5: Reinforcement Learning offers a framework to learn to choose actions in order to achieve some goal. However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The likelihood of survival is quite low if it is discovered in later stages (stages III and IV). The application of machine learning, deep learning, and data mining techniques in the medical industry has the potential to address current issues and bring benefits. Numerous symptoms of cancer exist, including tumors, unusual bleeding, increased weight loss, etc. It is not necessary for all tumor types to be cancerous. There are two sorts of tumors: benign and malignant. To give patients, the right care, symptoms must be carefully examined, and an automated system is to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Most data produced in today's online environment comes from websites related to healthcare or social media. Using data mining techniques, it is possible to extract symptoms from this vast amount of data, which will be helpful for identifying or classifying cancer. This research classifies bacteria cells as benign or cancerous using various deep-learning Algorithms.

Since cancer is so widespread, raising public awareness about its mechanisms can help those affected cope with its realities, as well as inspire others to make lifestyle adjustments and screen for the disease. Unfortunately, studies have shown that cancer literature is too technical for the general public to understand. We found that musification, the process of turning data into music, remains an unexplored avenue for conveying this information. We explore the pedagogical effectiveness of musification through the use of an algorithm that manipulates a piece of music in a manner analogous to the development of cancer. We conducted two lab studies and found that our approach is marginally more effective at promoting cancer literacy when accompanied by a text-based article than text-based articles alone.

Its FDA approval for several indications has yielded improved prognosis for cases where traditional therapy has shown limited efficiencey. However, many patients still fail to benefit from this treatment modality, and the exact mechanisms responsible for tumor response are unknown. Noninvasive treatment monitoring is crucial for longitudinal tumor characterization and the early detection of non-responders. While various medical imaging techniques can provide a morphological picture of the lesion and its surrounding tissue, a molecular-oriented imaging approach holds the key to unraveling biological effects that occur much earlier in the immunotherapy timeline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly versatile imaging modality, where the image contrast can be tailored to emphasize a particular biophysical property of interest using advanced engineering of the imaging pipeline. In this review, recent advances in molecular-MRI based cancer immunotherapy monitoring are described. Next, the presentation of the underlying physics, computational, and biological features are complemented by a critical analysis of the results obtained in preclinical and clinical studies.

Over the past decade, multimodal data integration technology for precision oncology has made significant strides, showcasing remarkable progress in understanding the intricate details within heterogeneous data modalities. These strides have exhibited tremendous potential for improving clinical decision-making and model interpretation, contributing to the advancement of cancer care and treatment.

A widely held view is that such collaborations, by fostering specialization and encouraging novel combinations of ideas, accelerate scientific innovation. However, recent research challenges this notion, suggesting that small teams and solo researchers consistently disrupt science and technology with fresh ideas and opportunities, while larger teams tend to refine existing ones (Wu et al. 2019). This study, along with other relevant research, has garnered attention for challenging the zeitgeist of our time that views collaboration as the inevitable path forward in scientific and technological advancement.

This review extracts recent AI technology advances for diagnosing colorectal cancer from January 2010 to March 2022. PubTrends was used to identify and automate the intellectual structure and comparable papers on the use of AI in colorectal cancer diagnosis using the most cited papers, keywords, and similar papers. Papers with quantitative results were represented with a tabular summary, and other paper contributions were in a sentence summary. Twenty-four (24) out of the forty-nine (49) top-cited papers were quantitative results, with one (1) outlier about lung cancer comprehensive screening. The most frequently used words were: \"polyps,\" \"detected\", \"image,\" and \"colonoscopy.\" In addition, 83 per cent of the terms frequently used shortly before 2022 were image, polyps, detected, colonoscopy, and learning.

Scientific research on different types of cancers grows at an ever-increasing rate, publishing large volumes of research articles every year. The insight information and the knowledge of the drug, diagnostics, risk, symptoms, treatments, etc., related to genes are significant factors that help explore and advance the cancer research progression. Manual screening of such a large volume of articles is very laborious and time-consuming to formulate any hypothesis. The study uses the two most non-trivial NLP, Natural Language Processing functions, Entity Recognition, and text classification to discover knowledge from biomedical literature. Named Entity Recognition (NER) recognizes and extracts the predefined entities related to cancer from unstructured text with the support of a user-friendly interface and built-in dictionaries. Text classification helps to explore the insights into the text and simplifies data categorization, querying, and article screening. Machine learning classifiers are also used to build the classification model and Structured Query Languages (SQL) is used to identify the hidden relations that may lead to significant predictions.

Over the past decade, multimodal data integration technology for precision oncology has made significant strides, showcasing remarkable progress in understanding the intricate details within heterogeneous data modalities. These strides have exhibited tremendous potential for improving clinical decision-making and model interpretation, contributing to the advancement of cancer care and treatment. Given the rapid progress that has been achieved, we provide a comprehensive overview of about 300 papers detailing cutting-edge multimodal data integration techniques in precision oncology. In addition, we conclude the primary clinical applications that have reaped significant benefits, including early assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, and biomarker discovery. Finally, derived from the findings of this survey, we present an in-depth analysis that explores the pivotal challenges and reveals essential pathways for future research in the field of multimodal data integration for precision oncology.

Its FDA approval for several indications has yielded improved prognosis for cases where traditional therapy has shown limited efficiencey. However, many patients still fail to benefit from this treatment modality, and the exact mechanisms responsible for tumor response are unknown. Noninvasive treatment monitoring is crucial for longitudinal tumor characterization and the early detection of non-responders. While various medical imaging techniques can provide a morphological picture of the lesion and its surrounding tissue, a molecular-oriented imaging approach holds the key to unraveling biological effects that occur much earlier in the immunotherapy timeline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly versatile imaging modality, where the image contrast can be tailored to emphasize a particular biophysical property of interest using advanced engineering of the imaging pipeline. In this review, recent advances in molecular-MRI based cancer immunotherapy monitoring are described. Next, the presentation of the underlying physics, computational, and biological features are complemented by a critical analysis of the results obtained in preclinical and clinical studies. Finally, emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies to further distill, quantify, and interpret the image-based molecular MRI information are discussed in terms of perspectives for the future.

Because there is now no effective treatment for this illness, it is a matter of concern. Only if this disease is discovered early may patients be rescued (stage I and stage II). The likelihood of survival is quite low if it is discovered in later stages (stages III and IV). The application of machine learning, deep learning, and data mining techniques in the medical industry has the potential to address current issues and bring benefits. Numerous symptoms of cancer exist, including tumors, unusual bleeding, increased weight loss, etc. It is not necessary for all tumor types to be cancerous. There are two sorts of tumors: benign and malignant. To give patients, the right care, symptoms must be carefully examined, and an automated system is to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Most data produced in today\\'s online environment comes from websites related to healthcare or social media. Using data mining techniques, it is possible to extract symptoms from this vast amount of data, which will be helpful for identifying or classifying cancer. This research classifies bacteria cells as benign or cancerous using various deep-learning Algorithms. To get the best and most reliable results for the classification, a variety of methodologies and models are trained and improved.

The growth of single-crystal 2D materials is the prerequisite to realize 2D-based high-performance applications. In this review, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art technology for the growth and applications of 2D materials, with particular emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking sequence, and heterostructure composition. Then we highlight the exploration of 2D single crystals in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Finally, a perspective is given to outline the research opportunities and the remaining challenges in this field.

The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices.

By summarizing the current trends in and prospects for utilizing multifunctional electrochromic devices (ECDs) in environmental monitoring, food quality control, medical diagnosis, and life science-related investigations, we explore the potential of using 2D materials for rational design of ECDs with compelling electrical and optical properties for biochemical sensing applications.

However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in 2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

We show how to reduce the three--dimensional energy functional to a one--dimensional one, similarly as in our previous work. This is done by minimizing over states invariant under magnetic translations and that commute with the Landau operator. In the reduced model, the Pauli principle no longer appears. It is replaced by a penalization term in the energy.

This position paper argues that, to enable more widespread adoption of RL, it is important for the research community to shift focus towards methodologies where environments are described in user-friendly domain-specific or natural languages. Aside from improving the usability of RL, such language-based environment descriptions may also provide valuable context and boost the ability of trained agents to generalise to unseen environments within the set of all environments that can be described in any language of choice.

In this paper, we implement an optics simulation environment for reinforcement learning based controllers. The environment captures the essence of nonconvexity, nonlinearity, and time-dependent noise inherent in optical systems, offering a more realistic setting. Subsequently, we provide the benchmark results of several reinforcement learning algorithms on the proposed simulation environment.

This thesis delineates the background of modern Reinforcement Learning (RL), starting with the framework constituted by the Markov decision processes, Markov properties, goals and rewards, agent-environment interactions, and policies. We explain the main types of algorithms commonly used in RL, including value-based, policy gradient, and actor-critic methods, with a special emphasis on DQN, A2C and PPO. We then give a short literature review on some widely adopted frameworks for implementing RL algorithms and environments. Subsequently, we present Bidimensional Gripper Environment (BGE), a virtual simulator based on the Pymunk physics engine we developed to analyse top-down bidimensional object manipulation. The methodology section frames our agent-environment interaction as a Markov decision process, such that we can apply our RL algorithms. We list various goal formulation strategies, including reward shaping and curriculum learning. We also employ different steps of observation preprocessing to reduce the computational workload required. In the experimental phase, we run through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. We start with a simple static scenario and then gradually increase the amount of stochasticity. Whenever the agents show difficulty in learning, we counteract by increasing the degree of reward shaping and curriculum learning. These experiments demonstrate the substantial limitations and pitfalls of model-free algorithms under changing dynamics. In conclusion, we present a summary of our findings and remarks. We then outline potential future work to improve our methodology and possibly expand to real-world systems.

Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions.

One of the key indicators of their applicability is their ability to scale and work in real-world scenarios, that is in large-scale problems. This scale can be achieved via a combination of factors, the algorithm's ability to make use of large amounts of data and computational resources and the efficient exploration of the environment for viable solutions (i.e. policies).\\n  In this work, we investigate and motivate some theoretical foundations for deep reinforcement learning. We start with exact dynamic programming and work our way up to stochastic approximations and stochastic approximations for a model-free scenario, which forms the theoretical basis of modern reinforcement learning. We present an overview of this highly varied and rapidly changing field from the perspective of Approximate Dynamic Programming. We then focus our study on the short-comings with respect to exploration of the cornerstone approaches (i.e. DQN, DDQN, A2C) in deep reinforcement learning. On the theory side, our main contribution is the proposal of a novel Bayesian actor-critic algorithm. On the empirical side, we evaluate Bayesian exploration as well as actor-critic algorithms on standard benchmarks as well as state-of-the-art evaluation suites and show the benefits of both of these approaches over current state-of-the-art deep RL methods. We release all the implementations and provide a full python library that is easy to install and hopefully will serve the reinforcement learning community in a meaningful way, and provide a strong foundation for future work.

This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping.

This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effective learning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications.

However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency.

However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \\\\textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations.

However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper the learning process. We analyze this regime using the general framework of Markov Decision Processes, which applies to a wide variety of problems from nano-navigation to nano-machine actuation. We show that at the nan-oscale, while optimal actions should bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by using actions learned at a lower temperature. These results are illustrated with simulations of the control of the shape of small particle clusters.

The likelihood of survival is quite low if it is discovered in later stages (stages III and IV). The application of machine learning, deep learning, and data mining techniques in the medical industry has the potential to address current issues and bring benefits. Numerous symptoms of cancer exist, including tumors, unusual bleeding, increased weight loss, etc. It is not necessary for all tumor types to be cancerous. There are two sorts of tumors: benign and malignant. To give patients, the right care, symptoms must be carefully examined, and an automated system is to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Most data produced in today's online environment comes from websites related to healthcare or social media. Using data mining techniques, it is possible to extract symptoms from this vast amount of data, which will be helpful for identifying or classifying cancer. This research classifies bacteria cells as benign or cancerous using various deep-learning Algorithms. To get the best and most reliable results for the classification, a variety of methodologies and models are trained and improved.

Since cancer is so widespread, raising public awareness about its mechanisms can help those affected cope with its realities, as well as inspire others to make lifestyle adjustments and screen for the disease. Unfortunately, studies have shown that cancer literature is too technical for the general public to understand. We found that musification, the process of turning data into music, remains an unexplored avenue for conveying this information. We explore the pedagogical effectiveness of musification through the use of an algorithm that manipulates a piece of music in a manner analogous to the development of cancer. We conducted two lab studies and found that our approach is marginally more effective at promoting cancer literacy when accompanied by a text-based article than text-based articles alone.

Noninvasive treatment monitoring is crucial for longitudinal tumor characterization and the early detection of non-responders. While various medical imaging techniques can provide a morphological picture of the lesion and its surrounding tissue, a molecular-oriented imaging approach holds the key to unraveling biological effects that occur much earlier in the immunotherapy timeline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly versatile imaging modality, where the image contrast can be tailored to emphasize a particular biophysical property of interest using advanced engineering of the imaging pipeline. In this review, recent advances in molecular-MRI based cancer immunotherapy monitoring are described. Next, the presentation of the underlying physics, computational, and biological features are complemented by a critical analysis of the results obtained in preclinical and clinical studies.

A widely held view is that such collaborations, by fostering specialization and encouraging novel combinations of ideas, accelerate scientific innovation. However, recent research challenges this notion, suggesting that small teams and solo researchers consistently disrupt science and technology with fresh ideas and opportunities, while larger teams tend to refine existing ones (Wu et al. 2019). This study, along with other relevant research, has garnered attention for challenging the zeitgeist of our time that views collaboration as the inevitable path forward in scientific and technological advancement. Yet, few studies have re-evaluated its central finding: the innovative advantage of small teams over large ones, using alternative measures. We explore innovation by identifying papers proposing new scientific concepts and patents introducing new technology codes. We analyzed 88 million research articles spanning from 1800 to 2020 and 7 million patent applications from 1976 to 2020 worldwide. Our findings confirm that while large teams contribute to development, small teams play a critical role in innovation by propelling fresh, original ideas in science and technology.

Due to numerous scholarly papers and broad enquiries about specific use cases for artificial intelligence (AI) in colorectal cancer, researchers find it challenging to explore relevant papers on the current knowledge, comprehensive knowledge, and past methodologies in the literature review. This review extracts recent AI technology advances for diagnosing colorectal cancer from January 2010 to March 2022. PubTrends was used to identify and automate the intellectual structure and comparable papers on the use of AI in colorectal cancer diagnosis using the most cited papers, keywords, and similar papers. Papers with quantitative results were represented with a tabular summary, and other paper contributions were in a sentence summary. Twenty-four (24) out of the forty-nine (49) top-cited papers were quantitative results, with one (1) outlier about lung cancer comprehensive screening. The most frequently used words were: \"polyps,\" \"detected\", \"image,\" and \"colonoscopy.\" In addition, 83 per cent of the terms frequently used shortly before 2022 were image, polyps, detected, colonoscopy, and learning. In addition, 16 per cent are preparation, variant, classification, sample, and surgery. The review showcases 49 of the 50 most cited papers, their notable contributions, objectives, specific AI methods, results, conclusions, and further recommendations. These papers highlight the limitations of colonoscopy for therapeutic use. The review concluded that despite the enormous benefits of using artificial intelligence, from improving diagnosis, the medical AI programmer still needs to be actively involved in the diagnosis team for effective results in CRC diagnosis.

Scientific research on different types of cancers grows at an ever-increasing rate, publishing large volumes of research articles every year. The insight information and the knowledge of the drug, diagnostics, risk, symptoms, treatments, etc., related to genes are significant factors that help explore and advance the cancer research progression. Manual screening of such a large volume of articles is very laborious and time-consuming to formulate any hypothesis. The study uses the two most non-trivial NLP, Natural Language Processing functions, Entity Recognition, and text classification to discover knowledge from biomedical literature. Named Entity Recognition (NER) recognizes and extracts the predefined entities related to cancer from unstructured text with the support of a user-friendly interface and built-in dictionaries. Text classification helps to explore the insights into the text and simplifies data categorization, querying, and article screening. Machine learning classifiers are also used to build the classification model and Structured Query Languages (SQL) is used to identify the hidden relations that may lead to significant predictions.

(https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05668)\\nDocument 3: Cancer diagnosis and prognosis primarily depend on clinical parameters such as age and tumor grade, and are increasingly complemented by molecular data, such as gene expression, from tumor sequencing. However, sequencing is costly and delays oncology workflows. Recent advances in Deep Learning allow to predict molecular information from morphological features within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), offering a cost-effective proxy of the molecular markers. While promising, current methods lack the robustness to fully replace direct sequencing. Here we aim to improve existing methods by introducing a model-agnostic framework that allows to inject prior knowledge on gene-gene interactions into Deep Learning architectures, thereby increasing accuracy and robustness. We design the framework to be generic and flexibly adaptable to a wide range of architectures. In a case study on breast cancer, our strategy leads to an average increase of 983 significant genes (out of 25,761) across all 18 experiments, with 14 generalizing to an increase on an independent dataset. Our findings reveal a high potential for injection of prior knowledge to increase gene expression prediction performance from WSIs across a wide range of architectures.

Traditional methods are often inadequate not merely because of the size in bytes of the data sets, but also because of the complexity of modern data sets. Mathematical limitations of familiar algorithms and techniques in dealing with such data sets create a critical need for new paradigms for the representation, analysis and scientific visualization (as opposed to illustrative visualization) of heterogeneous, multiresolution data across application domains. Some of the problems presented by the new data sets have been addressed by other disciplines such as applied mathematics, statistics and machine learning and have been utilized by other sciences such as space-based geosciences. Unfortunately, valuable results pertaining to these problems are mostly to be found only in publications outside of astronomy. Here we offer brief overviews of a number of concepts, techniques and developments, some \"old\" and some new. These are generally unknown to most of the astronomical community, but are vital to the analysis and visualization of complex datasets and images. In order for astronomers to take advantage of the richness and complexity of the new era of data, and to be able to identify, adopt, and apply new solutions, the astronomical community needs a certain degree of awareness and understanding of the new concepts. One of the goals of this paper is to help bridge the gap between applied mathematics, artificial intelligence and computer science on the one side and astronomy on the other.

Since its formalization as a discipline, conservation science has also increasingly incorporated tools from integrative biological fields, such as animal behavior, genetics, and, more recently, physiology. Given that the biodiversity crisis constitutes one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century, with tremendous consequences for global sustainability and human health, creating a diverse conservation toolbox is important for addressing complex conservation threats. To assess the integration of three emerging integrative biological disciplines (physiology, biomechanics, and technology) into recent conservation science research, we queried publications from five broad-scope conservation-focused journals from 2010-2022. We found that the proportion of published articles incorporating these integrative biological techniques was low, ranging from 0-4% per year. With only 2.1% of total articles accessing tools or techniques from conservation physiology, conservation technology, and conservation biomechanics, we propose that there is still a substantial opportunity for further integration. We provide a case study for each integrative field to illustrate the capacity for its tools to contribute to positive conservation outcomes. We further outline how each field promotes novel or reimagined opportunities for collaborations. Finally, we discuss the interconnectedness of the three fields and how they can support the continuing expansion of conservation science as an evidence-based, action-oriented discipline through the application of a Challenge-Mechanism-Partnership framework.

This survey paper summarizes the various technologies of LLMs in educational settings from multifaceted perspectives, encompassing student and teacher assistance, adaptive learning, and commercial tools. We systematically review the technological advancements in each perspective, organize related datasets and benchmarks, and identify the risks and challenges associated with deploying LLMs in education. Furthermore, we outline future research opportunities, highlighting the potential promising directions. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological picture for educators, researchers, and policymakers to harness the power of LLMs to revolutionize educational practices and foster a more effective personalized learning environment. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)\\nDocument 2: With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs, several exciting products and applications are emerging, many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks, in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper, we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard, a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google, on the standardized Physics GRE examination. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04613)\\nDocument 3: Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated.

It is intended to be useful to those in academia and industry who are interested in gaining an understanding of the key LLM concepts and technologies, and in utilising this knowledge in both day to day tasks and in more complex scenarios where this technology can enhance current practices and processes. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04503)\\nDocument 5: In recent years, the rapid advancement and impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evident across various domains. This paper explores the application, implications, and potential of LLMs in building energy efficiency and decarbonization studies. The wide-ranging capabilities of LLMs are examined in the context of the building energy field, including intelligent control systems, code generation, data infrastructure, knowledge extraction, and education. Despite the promising potential of LLMs, challenges including complex and expensive computation, data privacy, security and copyright, complexity in fine-tuned LLMs, and self-consistency are discussed. The paper concludes with a call for future research focused on the enhancement of LLMs for domain-specific tasks, multi-modal LLMs, and collaborative research between AI and energy experts.
